abstract: >
  SAWNERGY is a modular Python toolkit that converts MD trajectories into residue
  interaction networks (RINs), samples random and self-avoiding walks (including
  time-aware variants), and trains per-frame skip-gram embeddings using PureML or
  PyTorch backends. Artifacts are stored as compressed Zarr archives with rich metadata
  for reproducibility and downstream analysis.
