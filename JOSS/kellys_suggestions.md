Add to the paper, most relevant pieces from here, wherever it makes sense to include them throughout the paper:

JUSTIFY WHY USE ATTRACITVE INTERACTIONS AND RECOMMEND USING ATTR CHANNEL ONLY

**These embeddings enable tasks central to modern computational biophysics and drug discovery: comparing mutant and wild-type trajectories, quantifying ligand-induced rewiring, identifying communication hubs, clustering dynamic states, and generating ML-ready features grounded in physical interaction patterns.**
